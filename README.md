# Scriptura Mobile App

# To Do

- [ ] Add feature to pin projects
- [ ] Add marker to last position during revisions of a text
- [ ] Add an option to delete (with confirmation dialog) projects
- [ ] Add placeholders to loading objects
- [ ] Add a reorder option for non-pinned projects

# Bugs to Fix
- [ ] Changing the Home Folder doesn't update the projects unless you reopen the app
- [ ] Should Copy the image to the project folder before changing in the view

Obs: When needing to patch use `npx patch-package <lib-name> --use-yarn`
